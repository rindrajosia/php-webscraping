# php-webscraping

# PS: It seems that there is no resource about Coursera API on the internet as a result, I was not able to get all the necessary data. 
In addition to that, PHP seems not to be the best technology for making web scraping especially when the website is rendered by JS.

#1] Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/rindrajosia/php-webscraping.git
